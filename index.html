    Hi everyone, I’m Liz a senior at Syracuse University majoring in Policy Studies with a minor in Information Management & Technology with an interest in Public Health and Management. After graduation I am hoping to pursue a Masters Degree at Upstate Medical University here in Syracuse, New York. In what you may ask? I’ll let you know when I figure it out. Here at Syracuse University I’ve been able to develop a variety of helpful skills such as:
    Programming in Microsoft Excel
    Critical Thinking
    First Aid/CPR
    Positive Leadership and Team Building
    Adaptability Towards Various Situations
    Alongside the various helpful skills that I obtain, I’ve pursued an assortment of hobbies such as pottery and acrylic painting, which help me practice mindfulness during the school year. Different relaxing activities I partake in include: napping, meditating, and reading murder mystery books. During my downtime or while procrastinating assignments and when I am not rapidly scrolling through TikTok,  I keep up with new episodes of the Real Housewives of Salt Lake City and NJ, and I have recently started rewatching Family Guy.
